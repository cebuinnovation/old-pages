                    <p>A loose network of academics and students who use machine learning principally for university research and funded local government projects. We use machine learning (neural nets, support vector machines, k-clustering, Bayesian analysis, decision trees, random forest, linear and logistic regression, dimensionality reduction, gradient boost, etc) to solve many interesting problems: traffic patterns, population density, weather and climate, LIDAR data, disease epidemiology, etc. We communicate and meet online from time to time.</p>

                    <p>A very small group of speech synthesis and voice command and natural language processing enthusiasts mostly from academia, some medical doctors and a few other professionals. The group just launched last June 2017 a pioneering initiative called SpeechShare, a 2-hour workshop that helps people activate and work with simple speech commands using the Microsoft Operating System. Some members of the group are active with speech recognition and voice interfaces. Others work with text using different parsing systems. Some work on CEB dictionaries and online translation.</p>

Some academics and a number of professionals compose the group. A prominent geolocation foundation has been leading the group for some time and works with local governments for mapping projects. Many members of the group actively promote the use of geotechnologies for local government planning and corporate property management.</p>
